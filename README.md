## Abstract
For tuberizing crops like potato (Solanum tuberosum), the geocaulosphere, or the thin zone of soil in contact with and influenced by the tuber, is a distinct habitat that exists between the potato and the soil environment. Geocaulosphere soil that remains associated with the tuber after harvest is called tare soil. However, beyond potato pathogens, the microbes present in tare soil are understudied. In this study, we used ITS and 16S metabarcoding to characterize the microbial communities present in 130 tare soils of commercially produced seed potatoes used for potato production in Oregon. In 2018 and 2019, tare soils were sampled from seed potatoes that were opportunistically collected from farmers in the Columbia Basin of OR. This sampling effort included seed tubers of 23 cultivars that had originated from 40 commercial seed farms in 11 states. We identified a core microbiome consisting of 61 bacterial and 26 fungal taxa, some of which are not common to the potato microbiome, and others which have been reported to either possess biocontrol activities, promote plant growth, or cause disease in potato. Seed grower farm generally described the greatest amount of variability of the tare soil microbiome, and the composition of both fungal and bacterial communities in tare soil was more similar if the seed tubers were grown on nearby farms. Characterizing the microbial communities tare soil, as well as gaining a better understanding of the factors shaping their composition, will be essential steps towards potato microbiome management for improved plant health.
